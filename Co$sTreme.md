Tracking your spending is often the first step in getting your finances in order. By understanding what you spend money on and how much you spend, you can see exactly where your cash is going and areas where you can cut back.
It’s easy to make this part of your everyday routine thanks to expense tracker apps that help you manage your money on the go. 

These apps certainly overlap with budgeting apps, but while the latter provides a big-picture view of your finances, expense tracker apps put more of an emphasis on your spending.
These apps usually categorize your expenses and help you get a good idea of your purchasing behavior.

Whether you want an expense tracker app that easily captures all your transaction data, one that automates the expense reporting process at your job or one that holds you accountable by requiring you to manually input each one of your transactions, there’s an app out there for you.
